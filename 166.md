Seccomp is a Linux kernel feature that allows you to restrict the actions available within the container. By
using a seccomp profile, you can limit the system calls that a container can make, thus enhancing its security
and isolation. Docker has a default seccomp profile that blocks some potentially dangerous system calls, such
as mount, reboot, or ptrace. You can also pass a custom seccomp profile for a container using the --security-
opt option. Seccomp can limit a containerâ€™s access to host resources, such as CPU or memory, by blocking or
filtering system calls that affect those resources, such as setpriority, sched_setaffinity, or mlock. References:
